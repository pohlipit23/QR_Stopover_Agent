# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat API is currently failing with a Zod schema error when trying to process tool calls. The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_def')" indicates that the booking functions are not properly formatted for the AI SDK's tool system. This feature will fix the tool integration to ensure the chat functionality works correctly on localhost and in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat API to properly handle tool calls without throwing Zod schema errors, so that the chat functionality works correctly during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat API receives a request with tool calls THEN the system SHALL process the tools without throwing "_def" property errors
2. WHEN booking functions are called THEN the system SHALL properly validate parameters using correctly formatted Zod schemas
3. WHEN the AI SDK processes tools THEN the system SHALL recognize the tool schemas as valid Zod objects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user visiting the /chat-test page, I want to be able to interact with the chat interface without encountering server errors, so that I can test the stopover booking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit /chat-test THEN the page SHALL load without server errors
2. WHEN I send a message in the chat interface THEN the system SHALL respond without throwing schema validation errors
3. WHEN the AI attempts to use booking functions THEN the tools SHALL execute successfully with proper parameter validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the booking functions to be properly structured for the AI SDK, so that they can be used reliably in the chat system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN booking functions are defined THEN they SHALL use the correct AI SDK tool format with "parameters" property
2. WHEN tool schemas are processed THEN they SHALL be valid Zod schemas that can be converted to JSON schema
3. WHEN the AI SDK validates tool parameters THEN the validation SHALL succeed without undefined property access errors
